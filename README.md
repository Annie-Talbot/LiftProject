# LiftProject
As part of a first year university module called Data Structures and Algorithms, we were given a project to create a simulation of a lift in a building. We were then to attempt to optimise this lift. I created 2 solutions:
## The Mechanical Algorithm

## The Advanced Algorithm

## The Optimmum Algorithm

There are many controls here to adapt the simulation:
  * The number of floors in the building
  * The number of people spawned at the beginning of the simulation
  * Altering the probability of having a person spawn on a certain floor
  * Which algorithm to run
